But these are not photographs, he says; they are videos. Even if we can’t see them, there are tiny motions in the frame: the blood pulsing, the baby breathing. “We created software that finds the subtle motions in video and amplifies them so they become big enough for us to see,” Davis says, showing the images again, this time processed to magnify the tiny motions in the video. Now it’s easy to see a pulse in the wrist, to see the baby’s chest lift and fall.\n",
